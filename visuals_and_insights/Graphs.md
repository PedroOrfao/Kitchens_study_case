In this graph we can see clearly how **SushiFast** is far better than the others in these 3 days, with more than **2x the sales** of the closest competitor.  

Does this mean that monthly or yearly it will be twice as profitable? **Not necessarily**. It only means that something happened.  

In comparison to our **cluster chart**, we see that there is a small amount of clients, so it is unlikely to be sales of small items (which would probably attract more clients). Instead, this small number of clients made **huge purchases**.  

With no more data it is hard to guess, but possibilities include:  
- A strong sales team  
- Pure luck  
- The brand already being a staple in the field  
- Longer presence in the market compared to rivals  

ðŸ“Œ Example: In SÃ£o Paulo (where both BurgerX and SushiFast operate), there are around **8,000 burger stores** and only **600 sushi stores**. Would this explain almost **5x the sales** in this location? Probably not, but it is a good direction for further investigation with a more robust dataset.

### Multi-Location Brand Analysis

Another insight is that **BurgerX is the only brand present in two locations**, yet it has the **worst sales overall** when combining both stores.  

It cannot be blamed on location, since it **shares a location with SushiX**, which is performing very well.  

Possible reasons include:  
- Weak marketing  
- Low average ticket size  
- High competition in the region  

Most likely, it is a **mix of all of these factors**, already pointing toward directions for future analysis.
