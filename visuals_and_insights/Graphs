## Visualizations & Insights  

### Brand Performance Over Time  
![Brand Sales Comparison](Kitchens_study_case/visuals_and_insights/Images)

In this graph we can clearly see how **SushiFast** is far outperforming the others in these 3 days, with more than **2x the sales** of the closest competitor.  

Does this mean that monthly or yearly it will be twice as profitable? **Not necessarily**. It only shows that something happened during this short period.  

Comparing it with our **cluster chart**, we see that the number of clients is small, which means itâ€™s unlikely to be explained by small-item sales. Instead, a **small group of buyers made very large purchases**.  

With no further data, itâ€™s hard to guess the cause. Possible explanations could be:  
- A strong sales team  
- Sheer luck  
- The brand already being a staple in the market  
- Longer presence compared to rivals  

ðŸ“Œ Example: In SÃ£o Paulo (a city where both BurgerX and SushiFast operate), there are about **8,000 burger places** but only **600 sushi restaurants**. Would this explain the nearly 5x sales difference in this location? **Probably not**, but it is a starting point for deeper analysis with a larger dataset.

### Multi-Location Brand Analysis

Another insight is that **BurgerX is the only brand present in two locations**, yet it shows the **worst sales overall** when combining both stores.  

- This cannot be explained by location, since it **shares a location with SushiX**, which is performing very well.  
- Possible reasons:  
  - Weak marketing efforts  
  - Low average ticket size  
  - Higher competition in the burger segment  

Most likely itâ€™s a **combination of factors**, which already gives us **guidance for a future, larger-scale analysis**.
