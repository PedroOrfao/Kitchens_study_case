# Ghost Kitchen Analytics Project  

In this project, I explored tendencies and potential insights from a **very small dataset**. While small samples are often overlooked, they can still provide a useful overview of operations and raise valuable questions.  

The dataset was a **sample generated with Excel** (available in this repo), simulating a company that manages multiple **ghost kitchens**. Despite the limited size of the data, I aimed to extract some preliminary findings that could later be tested on larger datasets.  

## Key Questions and Observations  

- **Brand performance**: SushiShop appears to be outperforming other brands. But why?  
  - Could it be the specific dates covered in the dataset?  
  - Promotions or stronger online presence?  
  - Brand recognition, or simply better operational performance?  

- **Customer profile**: Buyers are distributed across both gender and age groups, with no strong concentration.  

- **Kitchen locations**: The three locations considered seem to be reasonably well placed. Poorer sales from certain brands may not necessarily be tied to location.  

## Next Steps  

This small-scale analysis demonstrates how even limited data can spark questions. With a larger dataset, these hypotheses could be tested more robustly, enabling deeper insights into:  

- Long-term sales trends  
- Regional and demographic patterns  
- Brand-specific growth opportunities
